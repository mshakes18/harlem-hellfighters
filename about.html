    <p class="about-text">369th Infantry Regiment aka The Harlem Hellfighters was an infantry regiment of the New York
      Army National Guard
      during World War I and World War II. The Regiment consisted
      mainly of African Americans, though it also included several Puerto Rican Americans during World War II. With the
      369th
      Infantry Regiment, it was known for being one of the first African American regiments to serve with the American
      Expeditionary Forces during World War I.
      The regiment was nicknamed the Black Rattlers. The nickname Men of Bronze (French: Hommes de Bronze) was given to
      the
      regiment by the French and Hell-fighters (German: Höllenkämpfer) was given to them by the Germans. During WWI,
      the 369th spent 191 days in frontline trenches, more than any other American unit. They also suffered the most
      losses of
      any American regiment, with 1,500 casualties.</p>
    <p class="about-text">They fought on the Western Front, notably in the Battle of Chateau-Thierry and the Battle of
      Belleau Wood during
      the Aisne-Marne Campaign.</p>

    <p class="about-text-two"> The unit distinguished themselves in combat, including in the Second Battle of the Marne
      on July 15, 1918. Fighting
      alongside the French, the 369th lost 14 men and sustained 51 injuries. In the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in Sechault,
      France, on Sept. 29, 1918, the 369th took the town, but suffered some of the worst casualties by an American
      regiment in
      the war. One-third of the unit were casualties of the battle.</p>
    <p class="about-text-two"> "Don't Tread On Me, God Damn, Let's Go!" was the Harlem Hellfighters motto</p>
