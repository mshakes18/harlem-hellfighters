      369th Infantry Regiment Memorial
      This monument honors the legendary 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters. The black granite
      obelisk
      is a replica of a 1997 memorial that stands at Sechault in Northern France, where the 369th soldiers
      distinguished
      themselves during World War I. Unveiled on September 29, 2006, the 88th anniversary of that battle, the obelisk
      is 12
      feet high and features gilded inscriptions, the 369thâ€™s crest, and its coiled rattlesnake insignia.

      Born William Henry Johnson in Winston Salem, North Carolina, Johnson moved to New York as a teenager. He worked
      various
      jobs - as a chauffeur, soda mixer, laborer in a coal yard, and a redcap porter at Albany's Union Station. He
      enlisted in
      the U.S. Army, June 5, 1917, and was assigned to Company C, 15th New York (Colored) Infantry Regiment - an
      all-black
      National Guard unit that would later become the 369th Infantry Regiment.
      For his battlefield valor, Johnson became one of the first Americans to be awarded the French Croix de Guerre
      avec
      Palme, France's highest award for valor.

      Johnson returned home from his tour and was unable to return to his pre-war porter position due to the severity
      of his
      21 combat injuries. Johnson died in July 1929. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington,
      Virginia.

      Johnson was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart in 1996 and the Distinguished Service Cross in 2002.

      President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously to Army Private Henry Johnson in 2015
      for conspicuous gallantry during World War I.
